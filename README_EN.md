🔧 RemoteKeyPad – Bring Back Your Mac Shortcuts
Tired of losing access to your favorite keyboard shortcuts when remotely controlling your Mac?
RemoteKeyPad is the elegant solution that brings them back — one click at a time.

🚀 What is RemoteKeyPad?
RemoteKeyPad is a lightweight macOS app that transforms a simple interface into a powerful shortcut launcher. Whether you're using Screen Sharing, VNC, or a remote desktop session, this app lets you trigger system-wide keyboard shortcuts — even the ones your remote session can't deliver.

With a single tap, simulate complex combinations like ⌘+C, ⌘+V, ⌘+Q, and more — no physical keyboard needed.
